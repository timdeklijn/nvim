# NVIM Config

This is created from the [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) starter template.

It also contains scripts to setup to setup `nvim` inside a `devpod`.

The `devpod` should be started with something like:

``` sh
devpod up --dotfiles git@github.com:timdeklijn/nvim.git --recreate .
```
```
```
